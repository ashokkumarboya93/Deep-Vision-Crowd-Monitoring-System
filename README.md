# DeepVision Crowd Monitor

### AI for Density Estimation and Overcrowding Detection

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**DeepVision Crowd Monitor** is a real-time **AI-powered system** designed to estimate crowd density and detect overcrowded zones from surveillance video feeds. By leveraging **deep learning** and **computer vision**, it empowers authorities to make proactive decisions that ensure public safety, improve crowd management, and streamline emergency response.

🌍 Applicable across high-footfall environments:
- 🚉 **Transit hubs**  
- 🎉 **Public events**  
- 🕌 **Religious gatherings**  
- 🌆 **Smart city infrastructures**  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Estimate crowd density** accurately in real time.  
- **Detect overcrowded zones** using adaptive thresholds.  
- **Automated alerts** to aid in quick decision-making.  
- **Interactive dashboards** for monitoring density heatmaps and alerts.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Video Input** → Live CCTV / surveillance feed.  
2. **Frame Extraction** → Extract frames at fixed intervals.  
3. **Preprocessing** → Resize, normalize, and clean images.  
4. **Crowd Estimation** → Generate density maps using CNN-based models (CSRNet/MCNN).  
5. **Counting & Detection** → Estimate counts and identify overcrowded zones.  
6. **Visualization & Alerts** → Display heatmaps and send real-time alerts.
